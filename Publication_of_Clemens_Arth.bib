abstract = {Many security documents contain machine readable zones (MRZ) for automatic inspection. An MRZ is intended to be read by dedicated machinery, which often requires a stationary setup. Although MRZ information can also be read using camera phones, current solutions require the user to align the document, which is rather tedious. We propose a real-time algorithm for MRZ detection and recognition on off-the-shelf mobile devices. In contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, we do not impose position restrictions on the document. Our system can instantly produce robust reading results from a large range of viewpoints, making it suitable for document verification or classification. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using a large synthetic database on a set of off-the-shelf smartphones. The obtained results prove that our solution is capable of achieving good reading accuracy despite using largely unconstrained viewpoints and mobile devices.},

abstract = {We propose an efficient method for estimating the motion of a multi-camera rig from a minimal set of feature correspondences. Existing methods for solving the multi-camera relative pose problem require extra correspondences, are slow to compute, and/or produce a multitude of solutions. Our solution uses a first-order approximation to relative pose in order to simplify the problem and produce an accurate estimate quickly. The solver is applicable to sequential multi-camera motion estimation and is fast enough for real-time implementation in a random sampling framework. Our experiments show that our approach is both stable and efficient on challenging test sequences.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) on mobile phones is receiving more and more attention recently, becoming a popular research topic and an important commercial field. In this paper we present a lightweight method to create coarse 3D models of small-scale objects. The goal is to give the users the possibility to create and maintain AR content themselves without the need for expensive tools and complex interaction. Our algorithm is based on shape-from-silhouette using voxel carving and runs on modern smartphone hardware. 3D models of certain object groups can be generated interactively and instantly. The actual result is visualized continuously using image based rendering methods to inform the user about the actual model quality. Given a suitably accurate model it can further be used for any means of AR and can easily be shared with other users. The usability of our approach is evaluated using modern smartphone hardware (see Figure 1). The advantages are demonstrated using a set of models for playing a board game.},

In this paper we present a novel system that allows for the generation of a coarse 3D model of the environment within several seconds on mobile smartphones. By using a very fast and flexible algorithm a set of panoramic images is captured to form the basis of wide field-of-view images required for reliable and robust reconstruction. A cheap on-line space carving approach based on Delaunay triangulation is employed to obtain dense, polygonal, textured representations. The use of an intuitive method to capture these images, as well as the efficiency of the reconstruction approach allows for an application on recent mobile phone hardware, giving visually pleasing results almost instantly.},

abstract = {We propose the combination of a keyframe-based monocular SLAM system and a global localization method. The SLAM system runs locally on a camera-equipped mobile client and provides continuous, relative 6DoF pose estimation as well as keyframe images with computed camera locations. As the local map expands, a server process localizes the keyframes with a pre-made, globally-registered map and returns the global registration correction to the mobile client. The localization result is updated each time a keyframe is added, and observations of global anchor points are added to the client-side bundle adjustment process to further refine the SLAM map registration and limit drift. The end result is a 6DoF tracking and mapping system which provides globally registered tracking in real-time on a mobile device, overcomes the difficulties of localization with a narrow field-of-view mobile phone camera, and is not limited to tracking only in areas covered by the offline reconstruction.},

abstract = {We propose a novel solution to the generalized camera pose problem which includes the internal scale of the generalized camera as an unknown parameter. This further generalization of the well-known absolute camera pose problem has applications in multi-frame loop closure. While a well-calibrated camera rig has a fixed and known scale, camera trajectories produced by monocular motion estimation necessarily lack a scale estimate. Thus, when performing loop closure in monocular visual odometry, or registering separate structure-from-motion reconstructions, we must estimate a seven degree-of-freedom similarity transform from corresponding observations. Existing approaches solve this problem, in specialized configurations, by aligning 3D triangulated points or individual camera pose estimates. Our approach handles general configurations of rays and points and directly estimates the full similarity transformation from the 2D-3D correspondences. Four correspondences are needed in the minimal case, which has eight possible solutions. The minimal solver can be used in a hypothesize-and-test architecture for robust transformation estimation. Our solver also produces a least-squares estimate in the overdetermined case. The approach is evaluated experimentally on synthetic and real datasets, and is shown to produce higher accuracy solutions to multi-frame loop closure than existing approaches.},

Then, multiple pose hypotheses are randomly distributed about the GPS/IMU measurement and use to produce renderings of the virtual model. With vision-based methods, the rendered images are compared with the image received from the smartphone, and the matching scores are used to update the particle filter.
