abstract = {We propose a method to detect changes in the geometry of a city using panoramic images captured by a car driving around the city. The proposed method can be used to significantly optimize the process of updating the 3D model of an urban environment that is changing over time, by restricting this process to only those areas where changes are detected. With this application in mind, we designed our algorithm to specifically detect only structural changes in the environment, ignoring any changes in its appearance, and ignoring also all the changes which are not relevant for update purposes such as cars, people etc. The approach also accounts for the challenges involved in a large scale application of change detection, such as inaccuracies in the input geometry, errors in the geo-location data of the images as well as the limited amount of information due to sparse imagery. We evaluated our approach on a small scale setup using high resolution, densely captured images and a large scale setup covering an entire city using instead the more realistic scenario of low resolution, sparsely captured images. A quantitative evaluation was also conducted for the large scale setup consisting of 14,000 images.},

@article{Bettio2015,
abstract = {We propose an approach for improving the digitization of shape and color of 3D artworks in a cluttered environment using 3D laser scanning and flash photography. To separate clutter from acquired material, semiautomated methods are employed to generate masks used to segment the range maps and the color photographs. This approach allows the removal of unwanted 3D and color data prior to the integration of acquired data in a 3D model. Sharp shadows generated by flash acquisition are easily handled by this masking process, and color deviations introduced by the flash light are corrected at the color blending step by taking into account the geometry of the object. The approach has been evaluated in a large-scale acquisition campaign of the Mont'e Prama complex. This site contains an extraordinary collection of stone fragments from the Nuragic era, which depict small models of prehistoric nuraghe (cone-shaped stone towers), as well as larger-than-life archers, warriors, and boxers. The acquisition campaign has covered 37 statues mounted on metallic supports. Color and shape were acquired at a resolution of 0.25mm, which resulted in more than 6,200 range maps (about 1.3G valid samples) and 3,817 photographs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Thermal infrared imagery of urban areas became interesting for urban climate investigations and thermal building inspections. Using a flying platform such as UAV or a helicopter for the acquisition and combining the thermal data with the 3D building models via texturing delivers a valuable groundwork for large-area building inspections. However, such thermal textures are useful for further analysis if they are geometrically correctly extracted. This can be achieved with a good coregistrations between the 3D building models and thermal images, which cannot be achieved by direct georeferencing. Hence, this paper presents methodology for alignment of 3D building models and oblique TIR image sequences taken from a flying platform. In a single image line correspondences between model edges and image line segments are found using accumulator approach and based on these correspondences an optimal camera pose is calculated to ensure the best match between the projected model and the image structures. Among the sequence the linear features are tracked based on visibility prediction. The results of the proposed methodology are presented using a TIR image sequence taken from helicopter in a densely built-up urban area. The novelty of this work is given by employing the uncertainty of the 3D building models and by innovative tracking strategy based on a priori knowledge from the 3D building model and the visibility checking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Gerke2014,
abstract = {Automatic urban object detection from airborne remote sensing data is essential to process and efficiently interpret the vast amount of airborne imagery and Laserscanning (ALS) data available today. This paper combines ALS data and airborne imagery to exploit both: the good geometric quality of ALS and the spectral image information to detect the four classes buildings, trees, vegetated ground and sealed ground. A new segmentation approach is introduced which also makes use of geometric and spectral data during classification entity definition. Geometric, textural, low level and mid level image features are assigned to laser points which are quantified into voxels. The segment information is transferred to the voxels and those clusters of voxels form the entity to be classified. Two classification strategies are pursued: a supervised method, using Random Trees and an unsupervised approach, embedded in a Markov Random Field framework and using graph-cuts for energy optimization. A further contribution of this paper concerns the image-based point densification for building roofs which aims to mitigate the accuracy problems related to large ALS point spacing.Results for the ISPRS benchmark test data show that to rely on color information to separate vegetation from non-vegetation areas does mostly lead to good results, but in particular in shadow areas a confusion between classes might occur. The unsupervised classification strategy is especially sensitive in this respect. As far as the point cloud densification is concerned, we observe similar sensitivity with respect to color which makes some planes to be missed out, or false detections still remain. For planes where the densification is successful we see the expected enhancement of the outline. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

abstract = {A method for online global pose estimation of aerial images by alignment with a georeferenced 3D model is presented. Motion stereo is used to reconstruct a dense local height patch from an image pair. The global pose is inferred from the 3D transform between the local height patch and the model. For efficiency, the sought 3D similarity transform is found by least-squares minimizations of three 2D subproblems. The method does not require any landmarks or reference points in the 3D model, but an approximate initialization of the global pose, in our case provided by onboard navigation sensors, is assumed. Real aerial images from helicopter and aircraft flights are used to evaluate the method. The results show that the accuracy of the position and orientation estimates is significantly improved compared to the initialization and our method is more robust than competing methods on similar datasets. The proposed matching error computed between the transformed patch and the map clearly indicates whether a reliable pose estimate has been obtained.},

abstract = {The management, processing and visualization of color information is a critical subject in the context of the acquisition and visualization of real objects. Especially in the context of Cultural Heritage, artifacts are so complex or hard-to-handle that the appearance information has to be extracted from a set of images. The images usually have to be registered to the 3D model of the objects, in order to transfer the needed information. Hence, the problem of image-to-geometry registration has been thoroughly studied by the Computer Graphics and Computer Vision community. Several methods have been proposed, but a fully automatic and generic solution is still missing. Moreover, small misalignments often lead to visible artifacts in the final colored 3D models. In this paper, we propose a method to refine the alignment of a group of images which has been already registered to a 3D model. Taking advantage of the overlapping among the images, and applying a statistical global method based on Mutual Information, the registration error is distributed among all the elements of the dataset. Hence, the quality of color projection is improved, especially when dealing with small details. The method was tested on a number of heterogeneous Cultural Heritage objects, bringing to a visible improvement in the rendering quality. The method is fully automatic, and it does not need powerful hardware or long processing time. Hence, it represents a valid solution for a wide application on CH artifacts.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for the localization of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) with respect to a ground robot. We solve the problem of registering the 3D maps computed by the robots using different sensors: a dense 3D reconstruction from the MAV monocular camera is aligned with the map computed from the depth sensor on the ground robot. Once aligned, the dense reconstruction from the MAV is used to augment the map computed by the ground robot, by extending it with the information conveyed by the aerial views. The overall approach is novel, as it builds on recent developments in live dense reconstruction from moving cameras to address the problem of air-ground localization. The core of our contribution is constituted by a novel algorithm integrating dense reconstructions from monocular views, Monte Carlo localization, and an iterative pose refinement. In spite of the radically different vantage points from which the maps are acquired, the proposed method achieves high accuracy whereas appearance-based, state-of-the-art approaches fail. Experimental validation in indoor and outdoor scenarios reported an accuracy in position estimation of 0.08 meters and real time performance. This demonstrates that our new approach effectively overcomes the limitations imposed by the difference in sensors and vantage points that negatively affect previous techniques relying on matching visual features.

abstract = {The photorealistic modeling of large-scale objects, such as urban scenes, requires the combination of range sensing technology and digital photography. In this paper, we attack the key problem of camera pose estimation, in an automatic and efficient way. First, the camera orientation is recovered by matching vanishing points (extracted from 2D images) with 3D directions (derived from a 3D range model). Then, a hypothesis-and-test algorithm computes the camera positions with respect to the 3D range model by matching corresponding 2D and 3D linear features. The camera positions are further optimized by minimizing a line-to-line distance. The advantage of our method over earlier work has to do with the fact that we do not need to rely on extracted planar facades, or other higher-order features; we are utilizing low-level linear features. That makes this method more general, robust, and efficient. We have also developed a user-interface for allowing users to accurately texture-map 2D images onto 3D range models at interactive rates. We have tested our system in a large variety of urban scenes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Our approach successfully handles cases where previous methods had problems, including objects on the ground, unoccupied space, and models covering a small area. We conclude our work by presenting several applications of our approach, namely the fusion of detailed SfM model information into the original DSM, season-invariant matching using aligned models, and alignment for providing context in visualization.},

abstract = {The complexity of natural scenes and the amount of information acquired by terrestrial laser scanners turn the registration among scans into a complex problem. This problem becomes even more challenging when two individual scans captured at significantly changed viewpoints (wide baseline). Since laser-scanning instruments nowadays are often equipped with an additional image sensor, it stands to reason making use of the image content to improve the registration process of 3D scanning data. In this paper, we present a novel improvement to the existing feature techniques to enable automatic alignment between two widely separated 3D scans. The key idea consists of extracting dominant planar structures from 3D point clouds and then utilizing the recovered 3D geometry to improve the performance of 2D image feature extraction and matching. The resulting features are very discriminative and robust to perspective distortions and viewpoint changes due to exploiting the underlying 3D structure. Using this novel viewpoint invariant feature, the corresponding 3D points are automatically linked in terms of wide baseline image matching. Initial experiments with real data demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for the challenging wide baseline 3D scanning data alignment tasks.},

abstract = {Airborne LiDAR technology draws increasing interest in large-scale 3D urban modeling in recent years. 3D LiDAR data typically has no texture information. To generate photo-realistic 3D models, oblique aerial images are needed for texture mapping, in which the key step is to obtain accurate registration between aerial images and untextured 3D LiDAR data. We present a robust automatic registration approach. A novel feature called 3CS is proposed which is composed of connected line segments. Putative line segment correspondences are obtained by matching 3CS features detected from both aerial images and 3D LiDAR data. Outliers are removed with a two-level RANSAC algorithm that integrates local and global processing to improve robustness and efficiency. The approach has been tested on 2290 aerial images that cover a variety of urban environments in Oakland and Atlanta areas. Its correct pose recovery rate is over 98{\%}. View full abstract},

Focusing on applications such as data fusion and rapid updating for GIS (geographic information systems) from diverse sources when accurate georeference is not available, our goal is a vision-based approach to recover the 2D to 3D transformation including orientation, scale and location. Two major challenges of 2D-3D registration systems are different sensors problem and large 3D viewpoint changes. Due to the challenging nature of the problem, we achieve the registration goal through a two-stage solution. The first stage of the proposed system uses a robust region matching method to handle different sensor problems registering 3D data onto 2D images with similar viewing directions. Robustness to 3D viewpoint changes is achieved by the second stage where 2D views with sensor variations compensated by the first stage are trained. Other views are rapidly matched to them and therefore indirectly registered with 3D LiDAR data. Experimental results using four cities' datasets have illustrated the potential of the proposed system.},

While several systems have been previously described which use hand-calibration or specific scenery to achieve this goal, the system described here is fully automatic and generates an accurate association without user intervention or calibration objects. The estimated parameters include the 7 classical camera parameters for a linear pinhole model, i.e., rotation, position, and focal length parameters, as well as an estimation of the radial distortion. The system uses a multi stage process to bootstrap difficult parameters based on robust estimates of easier ones. The calibration algorithm is tested empirically using free online data supplied as part of the DARPA Urban Challenge autonomous vehicle competition.

abstract = {A fast 3D model reconstruction methodology is desirable in many applications such as urban planning, training, and simulations. In this paper, we develop an automated algorithm for texture mapping oblique aerial images onto a 3D model generated from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Our proposed system consists of two steps. In the first step, we combine vanishing points and global positioning system aided inertial system readings to roughly estimate the extrinsic parameters of a calibrated camera. In the second step, we refine the coarse estimate of the first step by applying a series of processing steps. Specifically, We extract 2D corners corresponding to orthogonal 3D structural corners as features from both images and the untextured 3D LiDAR model. The correspondence between an image and the 3D model is then performed using Hough transform and generalized M-estimator sample consensus. The resulting 2D corner matches are used in Lowepsilas algorithm to refine camera parameters obtained earlier. Our system achieves 91{\%} correct pose recovery rate for 90 images over the downtown Berkeley area, and overall 61{\%} accuracy rate for 358 images over the residential, downtown and campus portions of the city of Berkeley.},

However, in Viola's original framework [1], surface albedo variance is assumed to be minimal when measuring similarity between 3D models and 2D image data using mutual information. In reality, most objects have textured surfaces with different albedo values across their surfaces, and direct application of this method in such circumstances will fail. To solve this problem, we propose to include spatial information into the original formulation by using histogram-based features of local regions that are robust to local but significant albedo variation. Neighborhood Extended Gaussian Images (NEGI) are used as descriptors to represent local surface regions on the 3D model, while pixel intensity data are considered within corresponding region windows on the image. Experiments on aligning 3D car models in cluttered scenes using this new framework demonstrate substantial improvement as compared to the original pixel-wise mutual information approach.},

Using point clouds enables the alignment for scenes full of objects that are difficult to model; for example, trees. To compute 3D point clouds from video, motion stereo is used along with a state-of-the-art algorithm for camera pose estimation.

The capability to align video before a 3D model is built from the 3D sensor data offers new practical opportunities for 3D modeling.

This further generalization of the well-known absolute camera pose problem has applications in multi-frame loop closure. While a well-calibrated camera rig has a fixed and known scale, camera trajectories produced by monocular motion estimation necessarily lack a scale estimate. Thus, when performing loop closure in monocular visual odometry, or registering separate structure-from-motion reconstructions, we must estimate a seven degree-of-freedom similarity transform from corresponding observations. Existing approaches solve this problem, in specialized configurations, by aligning 3D triangulated points or individual camera pose estimates. Our approach handles general configurations of rays and points and directly estimates the full similarity transformation from the 2D-3D correspondences. Four correspondences are needed in the minimal case, which has eight possible solutions. The minimal solver can be used in a hypothesize-and-test architecture for robust transformation estimation. Our solver also produces a least-squares estimate in the overdetermined case. The approach is evaluated experimentally on synthetic and real datasets, and is shown to produce higher accuracy solutions to multi-frame loop closure than existing approaches.},

In our approach, a textured, geo-registered model of the outdoor environment is used as a reference to estimate the pose of a smartphone. The device position and the orientation obtained from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are used as a first estimation of the true pose. Then, multiple pose hypotheses are randomly distributed about the GPS/IMU measurement and use to produce renderings of the virtual model. With vision-based methods, the rendered images are compared with the image received from the smartphone, and the matching scores are used to update the particle filter. The outcome of our system improves the camera pose estimate in real time without user assistance.},

Our contribution is a system architecture that lets heterogeneous clients contribute to a collaborative mapping effort, without prescribing fixed capabilities for the client devices.

In our research, we focus on phones as a platform for large- scale Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Thus, our aim is to estimate the position and orientation of the de- vice accurately and fast – it is unrealistic to assume that users are willing to wait tenths of seconds before they can interact with the application. We propose supple- menting vision methods with sensor readings from the compass and accelerometer available in most modern smartphones. We evaluate this approach on a large- scale reconstruction of the city center of Graz, Austria. Our results show that our approach improves both ac- curacy and localization time, in comparison to an ex- isting localization approach based solely on vision. We finally conclude our paper with a real-world validation of the approach on an iPhone 4S.},

Mobile AR setups using off-the-shelf smartphones can provide this information and support the verification process. However, current approaches lack in accuracy or are difficult to instruct to the user. We propose a series of designs for holograms suitable for mobile verification. They support the orthogonal sampling of elements within a constrained space along with an assessment of the capture conditions. We evaluated these designs regarding their verification performance and task completion time. The associated study revealed encouraging results for robust and efficient hologram verification on mobiles using a specially designed security element.},
