See ./Poster for short paper.
Poster draft is not yet available.

## 再次确认模板的时候，发现官方推荐使用最新的邋acm模板，不再使用以前的acmsiggraph模板了。所以我也改了。新模板有点问题:
* 新模板地址: http://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors, Sample Files章节。例子见./Poster/poster_abstract_example/new
* \citestyle 不能用，使得引用出错。
* siggraph 2017上给的poster abstract paper里面是没有abstract部分(也没有Keywords, ccs concepts部分)，但是新模板和新例子有。我们是不是也应该写一个abstact?


## Submission

Log in to the SIGGRAPH Information System, select "Begin a New Submission," and then select "create". You will be asked for:

Basic information about your submission (page 1)
Permissions (page 2)
A presentation format (page 3). To propose a Poster, please select Poster as your presentation format. You will then be taken to the forms specific to Posters. Please see below for more information about required information and materials for this presentation format.
Your submission must include the following materials and information:

* Basic information: This includes submitter name, affiliation, and contact information, as well as title of the work and a single-sentence summary that introduces the achievements of your work (50 words or fewer)
* One "representative image": This image should be suitable for use in the conference web site and promotional materials. See Representative Image Guidelines.
* Statement of permissions to use the submitted materials. This assures SIGGRAPH 2017 that you own the rights to your materials or have permission to use them.
* Poster abstract: An abstract (two pages maximum) describing your work (PDF). The abstract should include what area you are working in, what is novel about your work, and how this work relates to previous work on the same topic.
* Submission categories and keywords: You will be asked to tag your submission with appropriate keywords to help ensure your submission is reviewed and juried appropriately.
* Short video: If your poster is accepted, you will be required to submit a short video (30 seconds or less) that showcases your work. Information on the formatting specifications of the video will also be provided with the acceptance notification.
For guidance, we have provided both vertical and horizontal templates in Adobe Illustrator and PDF format, as well as three examples of recent SIGGRAPH abstracts and their corresponding posters. You are welcome to use these materials for general formatting suggestions. However, your abstract must also conform to these updated formatting guidelines.
