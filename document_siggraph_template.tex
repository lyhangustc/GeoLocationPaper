%%% template.annotated.tex
%%%
%%% This LaTeX source document can be used as the basis for your technical
%%% paper or abstract. Unlike ``template.tex,'' this version of the source
%%% document contains documentation of each of the commands and definitions
%%% that should be used in the preparation of your formatted document.
%%% 
%%% The parameter given to the ``acmsiggraph'' LaTeX class in the 
%%% ``\documentclass'' command controls several features of the formatted 
%%% output: the presence or absence of hyperlinked icons just prior to the 
%%% first section of the paper, the amount of space left clear for the ACM
%%% copyright notice, the presence or absence of line numbers and submission
%%% ID, and the presence or absence of an appropriate ``preprint'' notice.
%%% 
%%% If you are preparing a paper for presentation in the Technical Papers
%%% program at one of our two annual flagship conferences, held in North 
%%% America (SIGGRAPH) or Asia (SIGGRAPH Asia), you should use ``tog''
%%% as the parameter.
%%%
%%% If you are preparing a paper for presentation at one of our sponsored
%%% events, including SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia, but not in those events' 
%%% Technical Papers program, or a one- to four-page abstract, you should 
%%% use ``conference'' as the parameter.
%%% (Technical Briefs and Game Papers presented at our annual flagship 
%%% events fall into this category, as do papers accepted to other SIGGRAPH-
%%% sponsored events, such as I3D or ETRA or VRCAI, as do the one-page 
%%% abstracts which serve as the primary documentation for many of our 
%%% annual conference programs, including Posters, Talks, and Emerging 
%%% Technologies.)
%%%
%%% If you are preparing a version of your content for review, you should
%%% use ``review'' as the parameter. Line numbers will be added to your 
%%% paper, and the submission ID value will be printed across the top of 
%%% each page of your paper. (Use the submission ID as the parameter to the
%%% ``TOGonlineID'' command, below.)
%%%
%%% If you are preparing a preprint of your content, you should use
%%% ``preprint'' as the parameter. This is primarily for annual conference
%%% papers; a header reading ``To appear in ACM TOG X(Y)'' will appear on
%%% each page of the formatted output (where X is the volume and Y is the 
%%% number of the issue in which it will be published).

\documentclass[tog]{acmsiggraph}

%%% Definitions and commands that begin with ``\TOG'' are meant to be used
%%% in the preparation of papers to be presented in the Technical Papers
%%% program at one of our annual flagship events - SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH 
%%% Asia. You can safely ignore these definitions and commands if your 
%%% content is to be presented in some other venue.

%%% ``\TOGonlineid'' should be filled with the online ID value you received
%%% when you submitted your technical paper. It will be printed out if you 
%%% prepare a ``review'' version of your paper.

\TOGonlineid{45678}

%%% Should your technical paper be accepted, you will be given three pieces
%%% of information: the volume and number of the issue of the ACM Transactions
%%% on Graphics journal in which your paper will be published, and the 
%%% ``article DOI'' value, which is unique to your paper and provides the 
%%% link to your paper's page in the ACM Digital Library. Fill in the 
%%% ``\TOGvolume,'' ``\TOGnumber,'' and ``\TOGarticleDOI'' definitions with
%%% the three pieces of information you receive.

\TOGvolume{0}
\TOGnumber{0}
\TOGarticleDOI{1111111.2222222}

%%% By default, your technical paper will contain hyperlinked icons which 
%%% point to your paper's article page in the ACM Digital Library, and to 
%%% the paper itself in the ACM Digital Library. You may wish to add one 
%%% or more links to your own resources. If any of the following four 
%%% definitions have URLs in them, an appropriate hyperlinked icon will be
%%% added to the list. 

\TOGprojectURL{}
\TOGvideoURL{}
\TOGdataURL{}
\TOGcodeURL{}

%%% Define the title of your paper here. Use capital letters as appropriate.
%%% Setting the entire title in upper-case letters is not correct, nor is 
%%% capitalizing only the first letter of the title.

\title{The Title of Your Paper Goes Here}

%%% Define the author list in the ``\author'' command. The ``\thanks'' 
%%% field can be used to define an e-mail address for the author.
%%% The ``\pdfauthor'' field should contain a comma-separated list of the
%%% authors of the paper, and is used, along with the title and keyword
%%% data, for PDF metadata. (To see this metadata, open the PDF in Adobe 
%%% Reader and select ``File > Properties > Description.''

\author{Yuhang Li\thanks{e-mail:lyh9001@mail.ustc.edu.cn}\\Xuejin Chen\thanks{e-mail:xjchen99@ustc.edu.cn}}

%%% A ``teaser'' image appears below the title and affiliation and above
%%% the two-column body of the paper. This is optional, but if you wish
%%% to include such an image, the commented-out code, below, can be used
%%% as an example. Please note that the inclusion of a ``teaser'' image
%%% may move the copyright space to the bottom of the right-hand column

%%% The ``\maketitle'' command uses the author and title information

%%% The ``abstract'' environment should contain the abstract for your

%%% The ``CRCatlist'' environment defines one or more ACM ``Computing Review''

%%% If you are preparing a paper to be presented in the Technical Papers
%%% program at one of our annual flagship events (and, therefore, using 
%%% the ``tog'' parameter to the ``\documentclass'' command), the

%%% If you are using any other parameter to the ``\documentclass'' command
%%% this command does absolutely nothing.

%%% The ``\copyrightspace'' command will leave clear an amount of space
